## My process

I first focused on the HTML portion of the project. Also, began commenting out the styles that were already set on the heading. I first set up the body by adding multiple divs where I want the content to be. After adding the divs and images that I needed I moved on the the css to start off the styling. Please note: I have added comments to the codes in both html and css to explain the process.

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to practice my html and css as well as get more familiar with being organized with my code.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on organizing and setting up a process to complete my projects in a timley manner.

Also, I would like to practice more on moving my content around to be more confident with it.

### Useful resources

I turned to MDN webpage to refresh my memory when I got stuck. Also, I found it extrememly useful to seek more info on youtube or stackoverflow.
